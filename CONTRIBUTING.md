## Behavior guidelines

Be decent when talking to other in this repository. If you know that something will offend the person or persons with whom you are conversing, or you know that a person or persons who will find something which you intend to say offensive are going to be reading the conversation in the future, then avoid saying it. GitHub is not a chat site. It is meant for code and discussion of said code, as well as the project(s) at hand, first and foremost. Keep that in mind and you should be fine. Of course, there might be need for case-by-case intervention, but that is beyond the scope of the behavior guidelines in their current incarnation.
